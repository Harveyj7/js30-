      // start with strings, numbers and booleans

      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];

      // and we want to make a copy of it.

      // You might think we can just do something like this:
      const newplayer = players;

      // however what happens when we update that array?
      newplayer[2] = "tim";
      // now here is the problem!
      console.log(players);
      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

      // one way
      console.clear();
      const newplayer1 = players.slice();
      // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      const newplayers2 = [].concat(players);
      // or use the new ES6 Spread
      const newplayers3 = [...players];
      console.log(newplayer1, newplayers2, newplayers3);
      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
      newplayer1[1] = "jim";
      console.log(newplayer1, players);
      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80,
        hair: {
          color: "red",
          length: "long",
        },
      };

      // and think we make a copy:
      // const personcopy = person;
      // personcopy.age = 50;
      // console.log(person, personcopy);
      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const personcopy1 = Object.assign({}, person);
      personcopy1.age = 40;
      console.log(person, personcopy1);
      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      // const personcopy={...person}
      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
      const persondeepcopy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));
      persondeepcopy.hair.color = "blue";
      console.log(person, persondeepcopy1);
